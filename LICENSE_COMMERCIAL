MSSqlToPostgresMigrator — Commercial License Agreement
Version 1.0 — [Effective Date: 2025-10-01]

IMPORTANT: BY INSTALLING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE SOFTWARE (DEFINED BELOW) UNDER THIS COMMERCIAL LICENSE,
YOU ACCEPT ALL THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. Parties
   This Commercial License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between:
   • Licensor: Sard+ (a one-man company owned by Tigran Sardaryan) (“Licensor”)
   • Licensee: The individual or legal entity accepting this Agreement (“Licensee”).

2. Definitions
   “Software” means the source code, binaries, and documentation made available under the repository
   “MSSqlToPostgresMigrator” (https://github.com/tigransard/MSSqlToPostgresMigrator), including any modifications
   or derivative works made by Licensee.
   “Organization” means a single legal entity (including its wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates).
   “Conversion” means the migration of a database (schema, data, or both) using the Software, in part or in full,
   for a production or commercial purpose.
   “Use Case” means a project, client engagement, or internal initiative in which the Software is employed
   to migrate databases.

3. License Grant
   Subject to payment of applicable fees and compliance with this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a
   worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:
   a) install, use, and modify the Software within the Organization for any internal or commercial purpose;
   b) use the Software and any derivative works to perform migrations for clients or within the Organization;
   c) integrate the Software as part of internal workflows, migration pipelines, or service offerings,
      provided that the Software source code is not distributed or resold outside the Organization.

4. License Scope
   This license applies **per Organization and per Use Case**.
   Each Organization must hold its own commercial license for every independent commercial use of the Software.
   The license fee depends on the scope and scale of use, such as:
   • number of databases migrated or conversions performed;
   • database size, complexity, or migration volume;
   • financial value or benefit derived from using the Software.

5. Fee Determination
   Commercial license fees are determined based on the scope and value of use, including (but not limited to):
   a) the number and complexity of databases to be converted;
   b) the estimated engineering effort, time, and cost that would be required for the Licensee to independently
      design, implement, and maintain equivalent database conversion tooling or processes;
   c) any direct or indirect commercial value or operational benefit gained from using the Software.

   This model ensures that licensing costs remain proportionate to the real-world value of the Software and
   substantially lower than the cost of internal development.

6. Distribution & Restrictions
   a) Internal Use. Licensee may distribute and use the Software internally among its teams and affiliates
      solely under this Agreement.
   b) Client Work. Licensee may use the Software to perform migrations for clients, but may not transfer,
      sell, or sublicense the Software’s source code or compiled form to clients or third parties.
   c) No Public Distribution. Licensee shall not publicly share, publish, or make available the Software or
      derivative works in source or binary form, including via public repositories or marketplaces.
   d) Attribution. Licensee must retain copyright and license notices in all internal copies.

7. Fees, Term, and Renewal
   a) Fees are determined as described in Section 5, and confirmed in writing with the Licensor (e.g., invoice
      or purchase order).
   b) The license is perpetual for the agreed use case unless otherwise specified in the purchase terms.
   c) If Licensee’s use expands beyond the original scope (e.g., additional database conversions or new
      commercial projects), Licensee must contact Licensor to extend the license and adjust fees accordingly.

8. Ownership
   The Software is licensed, not sold. Licensor retains all rights, title, and interest in the Software.
   No ownership rights are transferred to Licensee.

9. Warranty Disclaimer
   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY,
   INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE,
   AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

10. Limitation of Liability
   TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED
   OF THE POSSIBILITY. LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY
   LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

11. Termination
   This Agreement terminates automatically upon Licensee’s material breach that remains uncured 15 days
   after written notice. Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use of the Software and destroy any copies.
   Sections 8–13 survive termination.

12. Compliance
   Licensee must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in its use of the Software, including export
   and data protection laws.

13. Governing Law & Jurisdiction
   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the **Netherlands**, excluding its conflict-of-law rules.
   The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the competent courts located in the Netherlands.

14. Dual-License Notice
   The Software is available under a Non-Commercial License (see LICENSE) for personal, educational,
   or non-revenue-generating use. Any commercial or profit-related use — including client services, SaaS,
   or internal production workloads — requires this Commercial License.
